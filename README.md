# zsh-sensible
This is a minimal sensible settings for zsh. For those new to zsh, frameworks such as [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) might be overwhelming.
This script enables the most important features of zsh, yet doesn't set anything confusing (like aliases).

# Install
This is nothing but a single script, so just downloading this and sourcing it works.
If you use zsh plugin managers such as antigen, you can use it as well.
